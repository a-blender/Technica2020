# SustainableShe
Technica 2020 mobile app scanner for sustainable women-owned clothing businesses.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for Sustainable She was a collective passion for raising awareness about the environment and empowering women owned businesses.

The Bangladesh clothing factory disaster and similar events around the world have inspired us to take a stand against the fast fashion industry. Fast fashion brands and supply chains create bad working conditions, environmental disasters, and even human tragedy. Despite this, relatively few people are truly conscious of the impact their clothing buying habits have on the world. Sustainable She makes it easy for people at any knowledge level to make an impact for the social good. Our application is a highly scalable and universally accessible method for helping individuals develop sustainable clothing consumption.

Ines Said created a number of environmentally conscious apps at previous hackathons and that inspired us to do the same for this project. Two of us also want to start our own companies and use of this app would lead to growth in female owned businesses by facilitating the rise in popularity of female owned brands. SUCCESS begins with SUPPORTING other women! Cheers.

## What It Does
The Sustainable She app enables women to scan clothing brands on storefronts, signs, and tags using AR technology and receive ratings and information about how sustainable that brand is. The app then gives you alternative women owned sustainable fashion brands that you can shop from instead.

## Technologies Used
We built our mobile app using Unity with Vuforia Engine for image recognition of the clothing brand logos and 3D model rendering, and C# for the navigation pages. We also used Google Cloud for sign in authentication and Google Firebase as our database to store key value pairs of brand names and ratings.

* Unity3D - platform for VR environment
* Vuforia - Unity's 3D modeling engine
* C# - driver for backend development
* Firebase - NoSQL database to hold textual representations of logos and company names
* Google cloud

What's next for Sustainable She

## What's next for Sustainable She
We have concrete steps for the future of Sustainable She:
* Implement OCR to convert clothing brand logos to text
* Connect mobile app to Google Firebase to dynamically pull ratings
* Implement web scraping to pull ratings from a reputable site (ex: goodonyou)
